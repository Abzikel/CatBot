# CatBot
Cat Bot is a Python app that automates sending the word "cat" with adjustable intervals via a PyQt5 GUI. Users set min/max send and wait times, with validation to ensure valid inputs. The app runs in the background with start/stop control and can be compiled into an executable for easy distribution.
